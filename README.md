# SW-DLT

SW-DLT ("Shortcuts Wrapper for -DL Tools") is an iOS shortcut that allows you to easily use, install and manage the popular and open source utilities [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [`gallery-dl`](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl). This shortcut aims to be compatible with [`yt-dlp's`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md) & [`gallery-dl's`](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.rst) collections of supported websites.

# PSA: Maintenance Mode

I cannot afford a device on iOS 16 at this time, and combined with a lack of time and motivation this project will be put on hold. Only support will be available to bugs in the shortcut affecting supported versions (iOS 14 & 15). Donations are already offered within the Shortcut's About menu and in the [RoutineHub Page](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7284/#:~:text=for%20SW%2DDLT.-,Donations,-If%20you%20have), for those who are interested in supporting future development.
